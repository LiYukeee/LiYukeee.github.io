# 从哪儿来,到哪儿去(Where you came from, where you're going)
我来自湖北省,在中国石油大学(华东)完成了本科阶段学位,即将前往上海科技大学攻读硕士学位,在可以预期的将来,我将会攻读机器学习领域博士学位,**我的家人十分支持我的这一决定**。

我想去北京看看,或者是合肥,或者是回老家武汉。**我不考虑呆在上海,这里太卷了!!!**

I am from Hubei Province, I have completed my undergraduate degree at China University of Petroleum (East China), and I am going to ShanghaiTech University to pursue my master's degree, and in the foreseeable future, I will pursue a PhD degree in the field of Machine Learning, **My family is very supportive of my decision**.

I'd like to visit Beijing, or Hefei, or go back home to Wuhan. **I don't think about staying in Shanghai, it's too JUAN!!!**
# 人生理想(Dream)
我的人生理想是找一份稳定轻松的工作。但是理想是必须照进现实的,稳定轻松基本上可以直接和穷划等号。所以我的人生理想是找一份**稳定且有上升空间**的工作。目前,我倾向于去研究所工作。

My ideal in life is to find a stable and easy job. But ideals must be reflected in reality, stable and easy basically can be directly equated with poor. So my dream is to find a **stable job with room for advancement**. At the moment, I'm leaning towards working at a research institute.


# 个人性格(Character)
我的MBTI是ENTJ,E为51%,理性为88%。外E内I,或者说真正遇到在意的人或事会是I人。我经常莫名其妙的忧虑前途,虽然忧虑了也没用。我喜欢工作和生活分开,在工作中我会很严肃,在生活中则非常随和。

**我喜欢简单直接的交流！如果你对我有任何的意见,请直接提出来！如果我有任何错误,请立即批评我！如果你的批评和意见是正确的,我将会不甚感激！**

My MBTI is ENTJ with 51% E and 88% rational. I'm an E on the outside and an I on the inside, or an I when it comes to people or things I really care about. I often worry about the future for no apparent reason, although it's useless to worry about it. I like to keep my work and life separate. I am very serious at work, but very easy-going in life.

**I like simple and direct communication! If you have any comments about me, please come to me directly! If I make any mistakes, please criticise me immediately! If your criticisms and opinions are correct, I will be very grateful!**

# 关于升学(About further education)
我因为保研期间的一些逸事被部分人熟知,简单来说,我曾经以**末流211rk42%**在保研夏令营入营**清华大学AIR,中科院计算所VIPL,浙江大学**等高校,并获得**中国科学技术大学六系优青**offer。保研失败后**两个月超复试线61分**考研上岸上海科技大学(**免复试**)VDI中心。了解更多关于我升学方面的趣事可以参考[1](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/659272255)和[2](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/686809221)

I was partially known because of some escapades during the guarantee period, simply put, I used to **last stream 211rk42%** in the guarantee summer camp into the camp **Tsinghua University AIR, Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Computing VIPL, Zhejiang University** and other colleges and universities, and to get the **University of Science and Technology of China, six departments of the excellent youth** offer.After the failure of the guarantee ** two months exceeded the retake line of 61 points** examination on the shore! Shanghai University of Science and Technology (**exempt from review**) VDI Centre.

# 关于学术(About Research)
在学术方面,我目前在上海科技大学从事具身智能,强化学习相关的研究,在Prof. Ye Shi的指导下。我在Visit期间受邀成为NeurIPS24和ICLR25的审稿人。在本科期间,我曾经进行计算机视觉方面的研究,在Prof. Wenjuan Gong指导下。进行统计学方面的研究,在Prof. Yunquan Song指导下。同时,我非常感谢Dr. Junyao Huh和 Mr. Xianglong Meng可以成为我在计算机视觉与数据挖掘方面的领路人！

Academically, I am currently working on Embodied Intelligence and Reinforcement Learning at ShanghaiTech University under the supervision of Prof. Ye Shi. I was invited to be a reviewer for NeurIPS24 and ICLR25 during Visit. During my undergraduate studies, I conducted research in computer vision under the supervision of Prof. Wenjuan Gong. I conducted research in statistics under the supervision of Prof. Yunquan Song. Meanwhile, I am very grateful to Dr. Junyao Hu and Mr. Xianglong Meng for being my guides in computer vision and data mining!

# 关于爱好(About Hobby)
<h1>我的兴趣爱好非常广泛！</h1>

我同时是多款3A大作(菜但爱玩,比如最近很火的黑猴,巫师三,GTA,古墓丽影,杀手等。一般都是比较简单的),2B游戏(比如原农之类的),4M游戏(三国杀启动！)的玩家。我不是很爱玩游戏,更多时候是为了打发时间或者是跟朋友们找个话题聊天。如果你也菜但是爱玩,我们可能是很好的朋友！我目前玩的游戏主要为：黑神话：悟空,崩坏：星穹铁道,LOLM,金铲铲之战

我喜欢错峰旅游！喜欢去看点山山水水,我的梦想是当一名大侠,虽然可能是因为初中高中武侠小说看多了导致的。我最喜欢的电影是**满城尽带黄金甲**。我喜欢一个人旅行,或者是不多于3个人出游。

我喜欢听粤语歌,我最喜欢的明星是周杰伦和陈奕迅！我最喜欢的歌曲是**海阔天空**

<h1>I have a wide range of interests!</h1>

I'm also a big fan of 3A games (like Black Monkey, The Witcher III, GTA, Tomb Raider, Hitman, etc.), 2B games (like Original Farming, etc.), 4M games (Triple Triad starter!).I'm not a big fan of gaming, more often than not it's just a way to pass the time or find a topic to talk about with friends. If you are a gamer but love to play, we could be good friends! The games I currently play are: Black Myth: Wukong, Wipeout: Star Dome Railroad, LOLM, Battle of the Golden Shovels.

I like to travel on the wrong side of the tracks! Love to go see some mountains and water, my dream is to be a warrior, although it may be caused by reading too many martial arts novels in junior high and high school. My favourite movie is **City Full of Gold**. I like travelling alone, or with no more than 3 people.

I like listening to Cantonese songs and my favourite stars are Jay Chou and Eason Chan! My favourite song is **The Sea is Wide and the Sky is High**.

# 关于利益(About Exchange)
我是一名商人,当你希望从我这里得到利益时,请思考你能给我提供什么,同时,我欢迎你用同样的方式对我。

PS.当然这里的利益指的是很大的事,如果仅仅是带一瓶冰红茶(我喜欢喝这个)我甚至不会找你要这瓶水的钱。

I am a businessman, when you wish to benefit from me, please think about what you can offer me, and at the same time, I welcome you to do the same to me.

PS. Of course the benefit here means something big, if it's just to bring a bottle of iced tea (which I like to drink) I won't even ask you for the money for the bottle of water.

# 研究兴趣(Research Interest)
我一直在机器学习领域进行一些探索。我对计算机视觉感兴趣,比如3D视觉。我也对具身智能和强化学习感兴趣,比如手物交互

I have been doing some exploration in the field of machine learning. I'm interested in computer vision, such as 3D vision. I'm also interested in embodied intelligence and reinforcement learning, such as hand-object interaction

# 日常生活(Daily Life)
目前的日常生活就是上班看看paper,下班打打游戏？感觉日复一日就是这样吧,人生不过三万天,我也不想干什么惊天动地的大事,过好自己的小日子就很好。

Currently, my daily life is to go to work, read papers, and play games after work. I feel like that's how it is day in and day out, life is only 30,000 days, I don't want to do anything amazing, just live a good life.
